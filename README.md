# customsdepositlist
The Hungarian Customs Office accepts electornic versions of deposit lists so the owe company can report its deposits to the bank system of the office using a special format file.
This utility can generate this kind of file based on the format requirements issued by the office.

The source file can be built with Borland XE2 or higher but you can download the executable alone.
